## Hello! - Introduction
![image-right](/images/favicon-2.ico){: .align-right height="17%" width="17%" align="right"}

I am currently studying Computer Science at [Cornell University](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (Class of 2019) and I will be completing a Master's of Engineering in December. I am interested in Math, Computer Science, and Machine Learning - and their pairwise intersections.

I created this web site to:
- Showcase my work for its quality or uniqueness
- Explain and talk about my interests
- Jot down various notes and become a better writer

## Interests
Besides software development, my interests also include:
- **Piano** - Played quite seriously when I was young (by 8th grade, I had performed at Carnegie Hall twice, received the Young Artist Diploma for the [National Piano Guild](https://pianoguild.com/), and was playing ARCT repertoire). Though things got busy, nowadays I still try to play when I can.
- **Reading** - Check me out on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56271666-lucas-chen). I plan on posting book reviews soon!
- **Religion & Philosophy** - A Christian, I dabble in theology & philosophy. My favorite philosopher is Augustine of Hippo.
- **Running** - I received the [Presidential Fitness Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Council_on_Sports,_Fitness,_and_Nutrition#Awards) the last time I took the (now defunct) test.
- **Chess** - A casual, amateur chess player, I'm rated 1800 ELO in Bullet/Blitz, 2200 ELO in Tactics on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/stats/live/bullet/snowcowtrader)
- **League of Legends** - I'm a Gold II Support Main, Zyra OTP.
